Breaking its own privacy rules. The NSA broke its own privacy rules thousands of times per year according to internal audits. In a particularly unsettling revelation, NSA officers abused surveillance powers to snoop on romantic interests. The practice was common enough it had its own slang: LOVEINT. The secret court that oversees the NSA's spying programs also rebuked the agency for repeatedly misleading it about the scope of surveillance.

This list makes it seem like there is hardly anything the NSA isn't doing -- and it's not even a full list. Countless additional stories or details suggest the scope of the NSA's activities are far beyond what most Americans realized before reporting on the Snowden documents.

And as these activities have come to light, a public debate ensued as have lawsuits, presidential task forces, and attempts at legislative remedy. But so far none of these have resulted in meaningful policy change. The status quo continues, if with forced disclosures and administration arguments that the public just doesn't understand how difficult it is to prevent the next 9/11 -- even though there's been no evidence publicly revealed so far that these measures have prevented the next 9/11.

But if 2013 is the year the NSA's surveillance capabilities were laid bare, perhaps 2014 will be the year the public figures out how to deal with it. As President Obama said, "weâ€™re going to have to make some choices as a society."
