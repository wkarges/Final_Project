Phone spying. The NSA collects information about everyone's domestic phone calls -- who you call, who calls you, when, and perhaps more information. While it denies intentionally targeting the location data of American citizens, it also collects 5 billion records a day concerning the location of cellphones and mobile devices around the world, including an unknown number of records about the the whereabouts of domestic cellphones that the NSA has collected "incidentally."
