Undermining consumer security. The NSA is waging a war on encryption -- and has been winning by "using supercomputers, technical trickery, court orders and behind-the-scenes persuasion to undermine the major tools protecting the privacy of everyday communications in the Internet age," according to The New York Times. It maintains a 50-page catalog of exploits and backdoors into the products of major tech companies -- and intercepts packages to put some of them there. If you have an iPhone, they can get in it. Along with its British counterpart, the agency also targeted anonymous browsing tool Tor -- albeit largely unsuccessfully. It also uses a system of secret servers to redirect and infect targets with malware tailored to compromise the target's computer system. To identify targets, it piggybacks onto the tracking mechanisms used by tech companies to identify targets for exploitation -- including one of the most common Google cookies.
